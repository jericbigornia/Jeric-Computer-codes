            Babie sleep the most, old people the least. During sleep, our bodies produce a growth hormone, 
            this only happens during our deepest slumber. The hormone repairs our bodies and in childhood, 
            helps us to grow. The more we sleep, the more we can sort out our heads. This is because plenty 
            of sleep-and therefore plenty of dreams-helps us to work out conscious and unconscious problems. 
            So if you want to be tall and cool, get sleeping.
